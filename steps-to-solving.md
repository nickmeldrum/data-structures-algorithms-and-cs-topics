7 steps:

 1. listen to all details - generally each detail is important to an optimal solution
 2. come up with good example
 3. brute force? - better slow than nothing at all - don't code it - state it, then optimize it
 4. optimize algorithm
 5. walk through your algorithm before coding - ensure 100% understanding of algorithm before coding
 6. start coding - DO name well, and DO modularize code
 7. test code - don't use example, analyse lines, small test cases, then think of edge cases - test code not the algo in your head


BUD

1. do a brute force solution
2. check solution for:

 * Bottlenecks
   e.g. if doing contains() type code, should we use a hashtable?

 * Unnecessary work
   e.g. can we break; ? if there is a break - can we flip the solution?

 * Duplicated work


space/time tradeoffs

 * always have hashtables at the front of your mind!

DIY

 * to find the algorithm - try it out yourself on an example to find the algo
