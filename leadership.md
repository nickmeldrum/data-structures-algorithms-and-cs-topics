people are complex, there is no simple quick-fix, one size fits all solution to creating high performing, happy teams.

There are however some good guidelines.


Motivation:

Create an environment where your developers care. Care about the team and even better the company.

Caring in humans is reciprocal. If you want a developer to care about the team, ensure you continually show care and compassion for them. This takes time, listening and personal one on one effort.


Team success not individual success:

There is a great video about this (TODO get link and precis)

Developers that are technically excellent is obviously great, however developers that you can trust, that want the team as a whole to succeed as much as they want themselves to succeed is MORE important. Individual excellence is way over-prioritised. If a developer is a lone wolf the damage that is caused can be immense and very difficult to see. This can damage teams for a very long time in quite deep ways.

Developers that work together with other people well can bring up the overall success of a team way over what they would be able to accomplish by themselves as a ninja.
