algorithms:

swap integers without using a temp variable 

log all pairs of arrays


 * sliding window technique:

time: O(n), space: O(n)

when it looks like we need to loop in a loop for O(n^2)
sometimes we can loop once with a "sliding window" (a substring essentially) within the array

how to identify when to use sliding window?
give example of one
